              My design process typically involves four key phases: research, design, prototype, and test. 
              In the research phase, I gather insights about the user and their needs. In the design phase, 
              I create wireframes and visual designs that meet those needs. In the prototype phase, 
              I create interactive models of the design for testing. In the test phase, I collect feedback 
              from users to refine the design.
